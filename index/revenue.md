### Description

The traditional definition of revenue is money generated from normal business operations, calculated as the average sales price multiplied by the number of units sold \[1]. For a service-business, revenue could be the average hourly rate multiplied by billable hours for services rendered.&#x20;

There is less consensus for web3 protocols and communities.&#x20;

Token Terminal defines revenue as the **share of fees** that goes to the protocolâ€™s treasury or directly to its token holders through a burn mechanism, where a burn mechanism is similar to a stock buyback because it decreases the amount of tokens in circulation \[2].

Messari offers a definition more centered on **yield** \[3]\[4]. For example, defining revenue for Convex Finance, Messari calculates total revenue as a combination of:

* Yield generated and harvested from Curve LP pools
* Yield generated and harvested from staked cvxCRV&#x20;
* Yield generated and harvested from staked CVX
* Yield generated and harvested from locked CVX
* Yield generated and harvested from Frax LP pools
* Yield generated and harvested from cvxFXS/FXS liquidity pools.
