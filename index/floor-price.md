At its core, an NFT floor price is the lowest NFT price in a collection.

NFT floor pricing lets market players determine the fair market value of an NFT collection. This supports an NFT buyer's decision-making and analysis by removing in-collection elements like rarity and qualities. The more popular an NFT project is, the higher its floor price. A rapid drop in a project's floor price may indicate it's losing steam.
