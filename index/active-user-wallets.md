### Description

_This definition and supporting materials are in progress. The goal is to lay out broad categories of users in general, and active users in particular, that may be relevant for different types of entities on the blockchain \[1]._

A definition of active user wallets rests on defining who the users (customers) are for a particular blockchain, or protocol, or a decentralized exchange (DEX), etc. This involves differentiating users (customers) from "institutional" and/or from "not human" addresses in web3 (smart contracts, multisig wallets, intermediary protocols, or bots).&#x20;

The actions that characterize a "user" can vary for different objects of analysis. Is one looking for the users of a protocol (and which type of protocol), a blockchain or ecosystem, etc.?&#x20;

* For instance, a DEX may be interested in "active user" metrics around human users who make swaps, deposit liquidity, and conduct other decentralized finance (DeFi) operations on their platform. This could potentially exclude intermediary transactions, e.g. a swap from a Metamask wallet that is executed on Uniswap.&#x20;
* As another example, an NFT marketplace may be interested in users who list, buy, and or/sell assets, among other possible metrics.

Another dimension is to make a distinction between _presumed human_ and _presumed non-human (bot)_ operated wallets.&#x20;

As an additional consideration, one can look at what constitutes sufficient activity for "active" user wallets. For instance, does one transaction a month qualify the wallet as "active" for that month?
