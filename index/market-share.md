### Description

Market capitalization (aka Market Cap / MCAP) of a cryptoasset is the price multiplied by its supply \[1]. CoinmarketCap uses a volume-weighted average of prices from multiple exchanges \[2].

Relatedly, Bitcoin Dominance is defined as the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to that of the rest of the cryptocurrency markets \[3].

We can define Market Share as the ratio of any cryptocurrency’s market capitalization to that of the rest of the market.
