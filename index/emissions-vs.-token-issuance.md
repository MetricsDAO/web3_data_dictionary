### Description

Token **issuance** is the process of creating new tokens and adding them to the token supply of a cryptocurrency \[1]. There is a release schedule associated with issuance, for example the initial release rate for CRV was 2m CRV per day \[2].&#x20;

The release _rate_, or **emissions**, is the _speed_ at which new coins are produced and released.&#x20;

Token projects will generally have a _release schedule_ for the community to view \[4].&#x20;

Messari distinguishes between four different general emission types, as well as more precise categorizations, including\[5]:

* Burn & Mint
* Deflationary
* Fixed Supply
* Inflationary.
