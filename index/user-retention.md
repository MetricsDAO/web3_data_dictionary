### Description

User Retention is the continued use of a product, feature or app by your customers. While measuring retention for feature usage is relatively straightforward (using that feature at least once in a specified period of time), measuring retention for a product or complete app requires more definition.

### **Thoughts and Comments**

* Is there a universal time limit or activities requirement for being "retained"? What are they?
* It depends on specific contexts when we describe user retention. Do the LP users retention, NFT user retention and Gamefi user retention share the same meaning?
