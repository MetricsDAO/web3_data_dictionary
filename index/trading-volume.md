### Description

Trading volume represents the total number of shares (stocks, securities) traded in a given time period; it is a technical indicator that confirms the existence of a trend \[1]. According to Coinbase, trading volume is the total amount of cash or crypto exchanged between buyers and sellers for a cryptocurrency or NFT collection \[2]. Similarly, Coinmarketcap’s Alexandria suggests volume is the sum total of actual trades taking place \[3].&#x20;
