### Description

Daily active users (DAU) is a metric used to measure the total number of unique users who engage with your product on a daily basis. The DAU shows the number of unique public addresses that transact with the dapps smart contract.

### Thoughts and Comments

* As Sign in with Ethereum gets popular, do off-chain activities like signing a signature count for being "active" or “engage with product”?
* DAU in different fields have the same meaning? e.g., DAU for Uni V3 LP have the same meaning as DAU in a Gamefi project?Related Term: Monthly active user (MAU): active users on a monthly basis
