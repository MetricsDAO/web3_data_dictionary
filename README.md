# web3 Data Dictionary

## Welcome

Welcome to the Web3 Data Dictionary! Created by [Dune](https://dune.com/) and [MetricsDAO](https://metricsdao.xyz/), this is a space to find and discuss shared definitions around key web3 data concepts.

## How did the dictionary come together?

First, in a [community-wide brainstorming period](https://metricsdao.notion.site/web3-Data-Dictionary-750546b7d18447f39ac145f8e9532f4f), the web3 analytics community [proposed and voted](https://bounty.metricsdao.xyz/bounty-programs/web3-data-glossary) on blockchain data terms that need defining.

Now, community analysts are at work sourcing and creating definitions for these terms, and rooting these definitions in analytics space consensus. This dictionary is actively in progress!

## I am active in the web3 data space and want to be involved
